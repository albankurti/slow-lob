# SLOW-LOB
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have a not slow execution that parses orderbooks from various exchanges with information coming in from websockets, 
inserts them into a Binary Search Tree, and visualizes
the aggregated orderbook. The visualization is intended to show the spread and a desired depth of the orderbook in a fast and neat way. \
This project is not crypto exclusive, the project is technically asset agnostic, it can aggregate any two or more orderbooks.
## Visualizing Result

### Suggestions
Suggestions are welcome, I'm happy to consider adjustments, especially adding new exchanges.
